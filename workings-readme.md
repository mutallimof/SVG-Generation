# MSc-Thesis
Registered for thesis on 30th of September!

First Meeting -> on 6th of October w/Prof. Magda and Philipp about 40 minutes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Meeting -> on 9th of October w/Prof. Magda, Philipp, Erik and Alexander(company allies) about an hour.  

Notes: 
Headings -> Text-to-SVG and raster-to-SVG!

Company name: Authentic Style.

Road of thesis: Survey(evaluation of existing SVG generators and raster-to-SVG converters / diff. variations) --> Building a Pipeline! 

One of the main metrics: non-trained model | code-untrained-just run | trained model 

Main requirements: 
- up to 7 colors
- speed
- variation
- no shades, one solid gradient
- limit of complexity, less shapes, less nodes
- editability

Cons: Multiple SVGs by single prompt! SVG simplication / SVG-to-SVG! 

Additional: ImageTrace of Illustrator/Canva!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third Meeting -> on 16th of October w/Philipp about 20 minutes. 

Additional note: All newer models (SVGDreamer, VectorFusion, NeuralSVG, etc.) â†’ use diffusion models inside to first create a raster image from text, and then vectorize that image into an editable SVG.
